# Architecture & Canon

## External Embodied Knowledge

AETHERIUM GENESIS does not encode formation knowledge internally.

All semantics related to:
- Intent → Motion
- Light emergence
- Voice-reactive embodiment

are canonically defined in:

**The Book of Formation – AETHERIUM GENESIS**
https://github.com/lnspirafirmaGPK/The-Book-of-Formation-AETHERIUM-GENESIS

This repository operates in conformance with that body of knowledge.
