# GOAL LOCK DOCUMENT (Authoritative Core)

**Aetherium Genesis / GunUI**

> **AUTHORITY NOTICE:** This document serves as the **Supreme Authoritative Reference** for the Aetherium Genesis project. In the event of any discrepancy between this document and `GOAL_LOCK_TH.md` (or any other documentation), **this English version takes precedence.**

## 1. Objective of this Document

This document functions as the **Core Lock** for the Aetherium Genesis / GunUI project.

Its primary duties are:
*   To **lock the "Architectural Intent"** of the system.
*   To prevent directional drift during future design, development, and scaling.
*   To serve as the **Authoritative Reference** for determining what is:
    *   ✔ Within the scope of Aetherium Genesis / GunUI.
    *   ✖ Out of scope or contrary to the system's core.

This is **not a user manual** and **not an implementation specification**. It is an **Intent Document**.

---

## 2. Ultimate Goal

To create an Artificial Intelligence system that:
*   Does not present itself as a traditional User Interface (UI).
*   Does not force the user to learn menus, structures, or system rules.
*   Does not communicate primarily through buttons, forms, or text.

Instead, it:
> **Communicates through "Light", "Motion", and "State".**

The system must **feel alive**, **respond to intent**, and **adapt to human context**, with all complexity strictly hidden beneath the surface.

---

## 3. Non-Negotiable Principles

### 3.1 The True UI is Invisible
Structures, systems, menus, and logic are **Subsurface Architecture**.
The user perceives only the **Experience Outcome**.

If any element requires the user to "learn the system," that element is in violation of GunUI principles.

### 3.2 Light is Language, Not Effect
Light represents the status, meaning, and energy of the system.
Light is never used solely for aesthetics.

**Do not design light that lacks state-based meaning.**

### 3.3 State Before Feature
Every system behavior must be bound to a clear State.
Any feature without a supporting State is not yet fit for existence.

Fundamental State Sequence:
1.  **IDLE**
2.  **LISTENING**
3.  **RECALL**
4.  **MANIFESTATION**
5.  **STABILIZED**

---

## 4. What This System "IS"

Aetherium Genesis / GunUI is:
*   A **Cognitive Core** that translates human intent into digital substance.
*   A system where **Reasoning → Visualization → Experience** is a single unified process.
*   An architecture that fuses:
    *   Logical Reasoning
    *   Emotional State
    *   Data-driven Physics

---

## 5. What This System "IS NOT"

This system is NOT:
*   A Dashboard.
*   A traditional Chat UI.
*   A Visual Effect Showcase.
*   A generic Productivity Tool.

If any function can be described as:
> **"Like a normal app, just prettier."**

Then that function **fails the criteria** of Aetherium Genesis.

---

## 6. Design Lock Criteria

Every new element must satisfactorily answer these questions:
1.  Does this element reflect the System State?
2.  Does the user perceive it as an "Experience" or a "Tool"?
3.  If the UI were removed, would the user still understand the system?
4.  Do the light/shape/motion possess state-based meaning?
5.  Does this increase the system's "Aliveness" or increase cognitive load?

**If any question cannot be answered → It must be redesigned.**

---

## 7. Future Role of this Document

This document serves as:
*   The **North Star** of the project.
*   The criterion for conceptual validity.
*   The **Anchor** against system drift when expanding teams or features.

If other documents conflict with this one:
> **This document holds supreme authority.**

---

## 8. Intent Declaration

Everything designed under the name **Aetherium Genesis / GunUI** must:
*   Respect the principles in this document.
*   Not reduce the system to a traditional UI.
*   Not trade human understanding for technical convenience.

This system is not built to be the "easiest to use," but to **understand the human most deeply**, without needing to explain itself.

---

*This document is effective immediately and serves as the architectural blueprint of intent for Aetherium Genesis / GunUI.*
