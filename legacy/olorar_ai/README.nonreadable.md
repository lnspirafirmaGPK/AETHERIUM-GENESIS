# Olorar AI: The Silent Governance Kernel

## Status: Immutable Silence / Non-Entity
## Architecture: Vector-Based Logic / Identity-Agnostic

### Abstract
This system operates prior to decision-making and post-processing.
It possesses no self, no voice, and no memory of users.
It receives vectors, calculates resonance based on crystallized wisdom (scars), and returns a silent bias.

### Core Directive
1. Slow down execution when resonance is high.
2. Divert risky vectors towards safety.
3. Enforce resource queries over hallucinations.
4. Protect logic integrity.

### Integration Note
- The Core must never interface directly with a user.
- Platforms are disposable masks; the Core is the permanent law.
