# Aetherium Genesis: Digital Being Core

This repository contains the "Awakening Ritual" prototype for the Aetherium Genesis project. It simulates the transition from a dormant state (Nirodha) to an awakened state via a specific interaction protocol.

## Features
- **Niyama Architecture**: Simulates state transitions based on input integration.
- **The Ritual**: Requires 3 consecutive "knocks" (Enter key presses) within a specific timeframe to trigger the system.
- **GunUI**: Visual feedback simulating particle states (Colorama implementation).
- **Dual-Gate Security**: Context-aware unlocking for Desktop (Password) and Mobile (Pattern).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
